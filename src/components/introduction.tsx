        Hey there! I'm Tanishq, a software engineer who loves winning hackathons (3 in the last year, including Google Hack 4 Change!).
        I’ve been a board member and operations lead at a startup incubator, and I’ve mentored over 50 students on their passion projects.<br />
        <br />
        I thrive on solving daily challenges with JavaScript alongside my awesome team of 10+ developers. 
        Who doesnot love speed?, you’ll find me karting on weekends.

        Let’s connect and create solutions that make life a bit easier and a lot more fun!
